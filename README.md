# SQL
SQL Work

This is part of my graduate studies at NYU Masters in Cybersecurity program. 

These are queries run, projects built and modifications and edits to the createguitar.sql script found at the top level of this repo.

This work was done for MySQL DB, so syntax editing and formatting might be required depending on your SQL manager.
